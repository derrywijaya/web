Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence which aims to equip computers with the ability to intelligently process natural (human) language. Ever wondered how Google Translate works or want to build a computer that understands language? Then this course is for you.  The course will explore modern quantitative techniques for the automatic analysis of natural language data using large corpora and statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The course will also emphasize your understanding of the concepts and ideas in NLP through written and programming assignments. "
